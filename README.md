# About

Bomberland is a 1v1 multi-agent environment inspired by the classic console game [Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman) organised by [Coder One](https://www.gocoder.one). For more information, check out the [Bomberland homepage](https://www.gocoder.one/bomberland).

Teams build intelligent agents using strategies from tree search to deep reinforcement learning. The goal is to compete in a 2D grid world collecting power-ups and placing explosives to take your opponent down.

This repo contains starter kits for working with the game API.

# Usage

See: [Documentation](https://www.gocoder.one/docs)

All starter kits provide an example for connecting with the game server via websockets, and how to send actions to the game server.

Start by cloning or downloading this repo (including both `base-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.yml` files).

To connect agents and run a game instance, run from the root directory:

```
docker-compose up --abort-on-container-exit --force-recreate
```

# Contributing
Contributions for Bomberland starter kits in other languages (as well improvements to existing starter kits) are welcome!

Starter kits in new languages should implement the simulation logic for handling game state updates (see [example](https://github.com/CoderOneHQ/starter-kits/blob/master/python3/game_state.py)) and follow the [validation schema](https://github.com/CoderOneHQ/starter-kits/blob/master/validation.schema.json).
