# About

[Bomberland](https://www.gocoder.one/bomberland?s=gh) is a 1v1 multi-agent environment inspired by the classic console game Bomberman.

Teams build intelligent agents using strategies from tree search to deep reinforcement learning. The goal is to compete in a 2D grid world collecting power-ups and placing explosives to take your opponent down.


This repo contains starter kits for working with the game API.

# Contributing
Contributions for Bomberland starter kits in other languages (as well improvements to existing starter kits) are welcome!

Starter kits in new languages should implement the simulation logic for handling game state updates (see [example](https://github.com/CoderOneHQ/starter-kits/blob/master/python3/game_state.py)) and follow the [validation schema](https://github.com/CoderOneHQ/starter-kits/blob/master/validation.schema.json).
